The staff were incredibly kind, professional and genuinely attentive. I felt like I was their only guest.
The suite was spacious, spotless, beautifully designed and felt like a true retreat.

Breakfast was another highlight, with a huge variety of fresh and delicious options.

The lounge was great, the food was generally very good, though occasionally some dishes, like beef or vegetables, were slightly overcooked /undercooked. We regularly shared feedback with the staff, and they were always responsive and took care of things.

A big shout-out to the concierge, reception team, and the staff at the door, everyone was consistently friendly, welcoming, and helpful throughout our stay. | downside was the air-conditioning in the room.

112,3,885,Review by Andrii,"- Location:
The location is perfect: the hotel sits inside the Baltic park on the main promenade. Walking to the beach takes around 3 minutes, and if you're not a fan of beaches, leave the hotel and you're all set for a nice walk around the promenade full of restaurants, shops and other tourist attractions. There's a convenience store right across the street, too.

- Hotel:
The hotel itself is very clean and well designed, with spacious rooms, two restaurants, open air swimming pool and underground water park, as well as with a nice area for playing billiards, bowling and table soccer. There was also an ice machine on our floor.

- Room, service and amenities:
Room service was impeccable: our room was kept clean every day, and we were given free water (both sparkling and still) after every cleaning session, in addition to free coffee. All of the supplies and amenities promised were also present: two bathrobes, slippers, a hair dryer, soap, shampoo, etc.

Breakfast: The complimentary breakfast offered a wide variety of dishes, all of which were flavorful and satisfying. | Cleaning: Upon check-in, we found the room generally clean; however, certain areas such as corners and behind the bathroom door appeared to have been overlooked. For instance, we noticed a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door, indicating that the cleaning in some spots was not thorough.

Housekeeping: Complimentary tea, coffee, milk, and two bottles of water were provided, which we appreciated. However, when we requested two additional bottles of water, it took multiple follow-ups with housekeeping and reception, and we eventually received them after nearly two hours.

The breakfast has good variety and quality food. The staff and service is good also. | I feel that the hotel is a bit on a pricier side, which is ok, and for the same type of hotels which I have stayed they have offered a bit more. For example, they don't give complimentary water or small snacks, only if you are a rewards member you get free bottled water in your room (or it seemed that way); and in my experience the hotels of this category usually offer this free for everyone.

323,7,503,Review by Suzanne,"The view over the old town was stunning and given every room is on floor 27 & above, all the views are amazing.  The bar and restaurant were reasonably priced and it was fantastic to sit and have a meal with stunning views over Lyon. The staff were all super friendly and extremely helpful, including everyone in the bar/restaurant. We have traditionally found that Radisson Blue staff are all well-trained in customer service and go out of there to be helpful. Free water/fruit and lollies in the reception was a nice touch. The bathroom was large with good amenities, and the bed was very comfortable.  There is an extra door between the hall and bedroom, which blocks any noise from the atrium.  The hotel is within walking distance from Lyon Part Dieu (via the Westfield Mall), and the Westfield Mall is right next door. We also had a great trip to the Les Halles De Lyon Paul Bocuse food market, which is about 5 minutes away and full of amazing food vendors and bars/restaurants. | The rooms ar",3.64,2025-06-17,0,booking_sparkling_awards,3.64,positive,0.32,2025-06-17T10:19:08.307269

369,8,322,Review by Suresh,"We had a premier sea view room. The view from the balcony was breathtaking.

It is at close proximity to public transport. Behind the property is the tram line. In front on the promenade is the 12+ bus that takes you from Airport to Old Nice. Very conveniently located bus and tram stations.

You step out of the hotel, cross the road and you are on the stretch that‚Äôs called the promenade. Very good place to run up and down in the morning against the cool breeze.

The staff were all lovely. And they were doing their job as best they could. I have read a lot comments about them being understaffed and attitude of some of the staff. Please take into consideration the fact that they are dealing with all kind of customers daily. You greeting them goes a long way towards making them feel appreciated too. 

Yes countries have different cultures and being bubbly may not come naturally to all. So it would be wrong to compare the reception people with ones who are running the buffet station.

Front desk was informed about our poor dinner and cut bill in half, and we appreciated that. | the shower was in a bathtub with a half door....it is difficult to shower in and move around as bottom of tub is curved .. and because it is a tub, space is limited.... should make a shower stall instead.  We had dinner in the rooftop restaurant and it was poor....had been traveling all day and just wanted a steak....a thin tough steak showed up and we sent them back....reordered hamburgers and they were ok, but we were looking for more.

- the roof-top restaurant - if this is a separate company - fire them.

The food upstairs was really, really awful - we filed a complaint, got a discount on our stakes (30%), but our overall experience was simply bad. The staff was helpful, but they were clearly trying to avoid talking to us as soon as we said something was wrong with our food (as soon as they heard it, they made every effort to avoid our section of the floor, often ignoring our requests or not fulfilling our additional orders (we ordered additional glasses of wine, which",2.54,2025-06-17,0,booking_sparkling_awards,2.54,negative,0.23,2025-06-17T10:19:08.307520

The room was not warm enough and was not able to be adjusted from the panel in room. After informing to the reception, yes, we had a warmer room, but as I understand this was possible by some adjustment done outside the room. 
We booked a room that looks outside instead of looking to the area inside the building. Yes, the room was looking outside. But just as an information, because of the situation of the building, most of the rooms has to be looking to the neighbour building. Better view rooms seems to be less.

The marbled lobby is sleek and inviting, with a well-laid-out check-in area to the left and a welcoming restaurant to the right. Plenty of seating makes it ideal for travellers waiting to move on. Though the glamour holds at first glance, signs of wear appear, notably a threadbare carpet on level four. Still, thanks to clear directions from Shane at reception, I found my room easily.

Check-in was a smooth and surprisingly upbeat experience. Shane managed to bring both humour and professionalism to the process, setting a positive tone from the outset.

The room itself looked promising: spacious, clean, and filled with light. All the expected amenities were there. Unfortunately, the bed was far firmer than expected ‚Äì a let-down given the comfort I‚Äôd experienced on a previous visit.

Avoid the restaurant on the ground floor.  I ordered a burger, medium rare.  Bit pricy at about $30 USD but it was late.  What they gave me was a grey, rock hard hockey puck burger.

Also the bar was mad expensive and food there was also only mediocre.

 - furniture in restaurant torn and dated

No turn down service

Alarm malfunction, went off a few days early in the morning for no reason and one day went of a number of times making resting a problem.

Our room was spotless and the bed was extremely comfortable, although there was damage to the window pane which was a bit unsightly when the blind was open.  The view from our window was fine (London Eye and Big Ben in the distance).  A room overlooking Leicester Square would have been nicer but would, not unreasonably, I think,  have cost more and may be noisier at night.

1131,23,979,Review by Bryant,"Because I am selfish, I was holding back on sharing my take on the Radisson Blu in Madrid because I wanted to keep it a secret. But after two, weeklong stays, I am willing to reveal the truth: the hotel's biggest suite has to be one of the best bargains in Madrid. It's a true, generous-sized suite, with 1.5 baths, and a small balcony, in just about the perfect location in the capital, especially for art lovers. You can literally see the Prado out your window. All this for a price that seems, frankly, unbelievable. The value-for-money is simply through the roof. And a special nod to the soundproofed windows, When I first checked in my first stay, I thought for sure the outdoor cafe just across the street would pose a big noise issue. Nope. | Radisson Blu is not a 5-star chain, maybe more like 3.8 star.

1148,23,184,Review by Ruth,"This is a great choice for anyone arriving at the main train station or wanting to spend time at the nearby Prado musuem. It also is well situated in terms of an excellent neighborhood of restaurants and bars. We at first expereinced a little confusion about how to arrive with a rental car, but this was clarified once we got there and in time to prevent us from a lot of hassle. The hotel does not have an actual parking facility, but there is a space around the corner from the hotel entrace which, if available, is a place you can temporarily park, unload your luggage, get checked in, etc. It can be reserved in advance, though there‚Äôs no guarantee it will be available. If unavailable, they can recommend other nearby parking options. The room was reasonably spacious and had a good safe, closet space, and useful room and bathroom amenities.

I had a fantastic experience at Radisson Blu Martinez, Beirut! The location is perfect, close to major attractions and easy to get around. The hotel itself is well-maintained, offering comfort and convenience.

What truly made my stay exceptional was the amazing staff‚Äîfriendly, professional, and always willing to help. A special mention to Ali Abdulla, who is by far the best manager! His dedication to guest satisfaction, attentiveness, and warm hospitality made all the difference.
